# LRU Cache Design-LLD
#### Design a low level cache LRU(Least Recently Used) Cache using Springboot

## Problem Statement
We have to do low level design for a Cache system. Cache that we will design will have to support following operations:
* **Put**: This will allow user to put a value against a key in the cache.
* **Get**: This will allow user to get the previously saved value using key.
* **Deletion**: Cache should also support removal of some key in case cache is full, and we try to add new key value.
* can be used as rest api to integrate with applications.
